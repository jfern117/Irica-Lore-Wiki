# Overview
Once the pride of a united [[Irica]], **Menopolis** is now a dilapidated shell of its former glory. The former capital of the land sits at the center of the landmass. The land around it is blighted, and few whoever enter there return.  [[Smarty D'Goodread|The Professor]] has strongly cautioned many adventurers from heading that way. 

# History
Menopolis was founded as the royal capital of the unified Irican government. It remained a seat of power to the government for many years, but following the [[Civil War]] and establishment of the [[Triarchy]], it lost much of its importance.

In the subsequent generations after, the neglected city was but a shell of its former self. This disorder allowed an army of [[Goblin]] to take over the city, igniting the brutal [[Goblin Wars]]. By the end of the war, Menopolis was in ruins, and a blight had spread from its land.
