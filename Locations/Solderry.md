# Overview

Village on the Northern Coast of Ostana. The only part of the provincial coastline that is able to sustain any level of sea travel - even this is at a limited capacity primarily reserved for newcomers from the north and goods being shipped to Ostana by sea.

**Solderry** is one of the few towns in [[Ostana]] with a port. This makes it of critical importance for the [[Ostana|Ostana's]] international trade, since otherwise it would be completely dependent on [[Marelia]].
