# Overview

This group of adventurers met while temporarily crewing the vessel [[Daphne's Grace]]. Following a mess of a murder in [[Solderry]], my partner and I discovered them on the road to [[Arborcrest]]. We took an immediate interest, and added entries to our catalogue to track what we knew would eventually be legendary exploits.
