# Overview

This group of adventurers met while temporarily crewing the vessel [[Daphne's Grace]]. Following a mess of a murder in [[Solderry]], my partner and I discovered them on the road to [[Arborcrest]]. We took an immediate interest, and added entries to our catalogue to track what we knew would eventually be legendary exploits. 

# Members

The following is a list of the members of this merry band:
- [[Bahia Catnap]]
- [[Doc Croc]]
- [[Elfaba Sincere]]
- [[Inka "Gran" Bevano]]
- [[Osbert Ashbourne]]
- [[Persephone "Ruby" Willotree]] 

Meta: 
- Feel free to add your own write up of your characters backstory. See Osbert's as an example.
- Osbert's backstory has some secretive information that has been encrypted. It is my intention to (1) reveal text over time to the group and (2) add hints to encrypted documents such that anyone who is super detailed oriented could unlock some secrets early. A few things are currently meant to unlockable with information the party has.
	- see [[Sample Encrypted Document.mdenc|Sample Encrytped Document]] For an example of how to format an encrypted note related to your character's backstory. The password is password. This can be used for NPCS, locations, etc. from your characters backstory you want to reveal later
	- I'd recommend keeping a document **outside** of the wiki with your passwords. I have a .txt document with hint:password pairs. Share this with Mike privately!
