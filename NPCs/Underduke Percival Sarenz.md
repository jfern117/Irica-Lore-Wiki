# Overview
[[Half-elf]] that is the presiding Underduke for [[Solderry]]. Seems to not care much for governing and prefers an easy solution. Very willing to throw money around.

# Known History

Shortly following Underduke Sarenz' coronation 10 years ago, [[Solderry]] townsfolk [[Hamlin Seldon|Hamlin Dewey's]] parents disappeared in the nearby forest while gathering herbs. Underduke Sarenz refused to help [[Hamlin Seldon|Hamlin]] by sending a search party, so the young [[half-orc]] went by himself. He found his parents killed, seemingly by [[Goblin|goblins]]. Because of this and presumably similar incidents, many of the townsfolk do not trust Sarenz' leadership, often relying on [[Heskell Gremnir]].

# Previous Encounters

[[The Party]] encountered Underduke Sarenz after resolving the murder case in [[Solderry]]. He did not leave a good first impression. At a invited dinner afterwards, he asked [[The Party]] to eliminate an issue with bandits he was having in [[Arborcrest]].
