# Overview
This is intended to be a resource for all members of our campaign for keeping track of the lore we've learned. It's also meant to be a bit silly and community driven. If you have questions about how to help out, feel free to ask Jimmy!



# Getting Started
To work with the wiki, you'll need to install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), its free and available for a bunch of platforms, and then download this repo and open it up in obsidian.
